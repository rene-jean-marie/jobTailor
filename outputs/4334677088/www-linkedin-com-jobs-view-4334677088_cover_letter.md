Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Quantitative Researcher position at Albert Bow, as advertised. With a First-Class Honours degree in Mathematics from the University of Warwick and over a year of experience in quantitative research, I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and technical expertise to your team.

In my current role as a Quantitative Game Mathematician at RAWiGaming, I have developed and implemented sophisticated mathematical models using C++ and Python, focusing on risk-reward calibration and system efficiency. This experience has honed my ability to analyse large datasets and build models, aligning well with your requirement for market data analysis and model development.

During my tenure as a Junior Games Mathematician at Push Gaming, I designed and validated the statistical core of online applications, ensuring mathematical integrity. This involved conducting rigorous time-series analysis, which is directly applicable to identifying market microstructure patterns as outlined in your job description. My strong foundation in statistical modelling and predictive analytics has equipped me to design and backtest short-term predictive signals effectively.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity at Albert Bow due to your focus on high-frequency trading strategies. While my experience in this specific area is limited, my proficiency in programming and my ability to prototype high-performance models will enable me to quickly adapt and contribute to your innovative projects. Additionally, I have streamlined analytical workflows using advanced Excel functions, which speaks to my capability in developing research pipelines to enhance strategy testing efficiency.

I am excited about the prospect of iteratively improving models through experimentation and analysis at Albert Bow. I am confident that my quantitative skills and passion for data-driven decision-making will make a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of Albert Bow.

Yours sincerely,
