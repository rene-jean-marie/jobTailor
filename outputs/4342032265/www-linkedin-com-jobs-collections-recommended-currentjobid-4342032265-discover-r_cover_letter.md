Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the systematic trading strategist position at Onyx Capital Group. As a First-Class Mathematics graduate from the University of Warwick, I have developed a robust foundation in Stochastic Processes, Markov Chains, and Game Theory, which I believe aligns perfectly with the analytical demands of this role. My experience in developing high-performance mathematical models using C++, Python, and Java equips me with the technical skills necessary to contribute effectively to your team.

In my current role as a Quantitative Game Mathematician at RAWiGaming, I have successfully implemented sophisticated C++ models focused on risk-reward calibration and system efficiency. This experience has honed my ability to conduct rigorous time-series analysis and automate complex workflows, ensuring optimal performance in fast-paced environments. Additionally, my previous position at Push Gaming allowed me to design and validate statistical cores for online applications, reinforcing my commitment to maintaining mathematical integrity and robustness in all my work.

I am particularly drawn to Onyx Capital Group's innovative approach to systematic trading and its emphasis on data-driven decision-making. I am eager to leverage my strong analytical skills and passion for quantitative finance to develop high-quality trading strategies that drive success for your firm. I am confident that my background and dedication to excellence will make a meaningful contribution to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of Onyx Capital Group.

Sincerely,  
Rene Jean-Marie
