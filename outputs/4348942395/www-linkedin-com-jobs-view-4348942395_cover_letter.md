Hiring Manager  
Anson McCade  
London Area, United Kingdom  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Quantitative Analyst position at Anson McCade, as advertised. With a First-Class Honours degree in Mathematics from the University of Warwick and hands-on experience in quantitative modelling, I am well-prepared to contribute to your automated trading infrastructure.

In my current role as a Quantitative Game Mathematician at RAWiGaming, I have developed and implemented sophisticated mathematical models using Python and C++. This experience has honed my ability to maintain and enhance codebases, focusing on risk-reward calibration and system efficiency, which aligns with your requirement for optimizing trading strategies.

Collaboration is key in dynamic trading environments, and I have successfully worked alongside teams to conduct rigorous time-series analyses, optimising performance and automating workflows. My role has required effective communication skills, demonstrated through my leadership as President of the Warwick Pride Society, where I coordinated stakeholders and organised large-scale events. This experience has equipped me to articulate complex quantitative concepts clearly and effectively.

I am adept at managing large datasets, having streamlined analytical workflows using advanced Excel functions and Python for data-driven modelling. This has enhanced the integrity and usability of data in both research and live trading contexts, ensuring robust decision-making processes.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my analytical skills and collaborative spirit to Anson McCade. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team and support the evolving requirements of your trading strategies.

Thank you for considering my application. I hope to speak with you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Rene Jean-Marie
